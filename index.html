    <h3>Daily Summary</h3>
    <p><strong>Day-0001:</strong> Took the first steps to becoming a programmer, or "coder" as referred to by some. I have to say,
    just the initial bit of knowledge required to actually start learning how to code is staggering. The tools
    needed just to begin are simple, yet vast.
    There appears to be no shortage of utilies designed by, what seem to be, some very intelligent, creative,
    and outgoing individuals. This journey will probably be more difficult than I originally thought.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Day-0002:</strong> Continuing with yesterday's startup; learning to modify the layout using CSS, experimenting with dividers,
    and alternate features, such as hover effects. I am looking into more directional examples and teachings, instead of trying to learn
    everything from sparce exaples.
    I have also moved away from the basic text editor and moved into <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">
      Visual Studio 2022</a>... which will take some learning too. A friend
    has shown me some features in Visual Studio that, at first, seem fairly insignificant; however, after watching the subtle finger twitching
    to accomplish in a split-second, which takes me 3 seconds to click-click-click, I can see why the need for soooo many keyboard shortcuts
    exits for these feature-rich editors.
    <br/>
    One thing that I do like is how the compilers are built into the editors, whereas before I was having difficulty getting my head to fully
    understand all the knowledge required for using 'command-line compilers'. I was originally instructed to start using it that way, so that
    I would fully appreciate the ease of what has become, as apposed to what once was. I must say, I like it much better how it is NOW than THEN.
    <br/>
    I am having some 'issues' with getting things updated in my GitHub repository. The way my friend uses Visual Studio makes it seem super
    easy, literally 3-clicks and done... whereas Atom and Visual Studio for Mac seem to function a bit differently.
