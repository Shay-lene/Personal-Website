    <h3>Daily Summary</h3>
    <strong>Day-0001:</strong> Took the first steps to becoming a programmer, or "coder" as referred to by some. I have to say,
    just the initial bit of knowledge required to actually start learning how to code is staggering. The tools
    needed just to begin are simple, yet vast.
    There appears to be no shortage of utilies designed by, what seem to be, some very intelligent, creative,
    and outgoing individuals. This journey will probably be more difficult than I originally thought.
